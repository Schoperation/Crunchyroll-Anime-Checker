# Crunchyroll Anime Checker

### About

![Latest English sub episode for One Piece, as of 01/26/24](cranimechecker.gif)

[Tidbyt](https://tidbyt.com/) app to check the latest episodes of an anime on [Crunchyroll](https://www.crunchyroll.com/)!

The actual app is the `cranimechecker.star` file. Everything else is for the code that retrieves the anime information from Crunchyroll and generates files for the app to display.

### TODO

- Tests.
- Add more locales... keeping it at English and Spanish for now to ensure everything's still smooth.
- More commands to help me add said locales, including force-update anime entries.
- (?) Incorporate the [AniList API](https://anilist.gitbook.io/anilist-apiv2-docs/) to countdown next episodes (I had no idea this existed until I was finished... bruh moment)
- Any suggestions or bugs. If you have any, feel free to open up an Issue above.
